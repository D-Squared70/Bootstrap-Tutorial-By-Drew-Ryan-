Description --> 

Hey there stranger,

You're looking at a simple site I've pulled together with some serious help from Drew Ryan... But I figured if I'm going to spend time on this I should have some fun with it. Ha! 

You'll quickly notice that the images and links in this site are all decked out in Rick & Morty goodies... If you couldn't tell I'm excited for season 4's arrival. 

Feel free to take this and make it your own master piece. :)
